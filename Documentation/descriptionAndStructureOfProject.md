Subject of the Project: Game of Tetris.

Tetris is a tile-matching puzzle game, where the player tries to tile falling tetromino blocks (called tetriminoes in the game)
so that the blocks form solid rows. Player can manipulate tetriminoes, by moving them sideways and rotating them 90 degrees
with each rotation. When a row is filled, it disappears from the playing field and any block over the disappearing line
will fall. If a player manages to fill four rows at the same time, that is called a "tetris".

After certain amount of cleared rows the game enters to a new level and the rate at which the tetriminoes descent increases.
Game cannot be paused because that can be used as a mechanism for cheating (by giving player time to think where he/she
should place the falling tetriminoe).
Game ends when the tiled tetrimino blocks reaches such height that new tetrimino block that is entering the playing field
does not have a room to fall completely into the field.

Users: Player (anyone interested in playing the game).

Actions of the player:
  - Moving tetrimino blocks to the left and right.
  - Instant dropping of the tetrimino block to the bottom of the playing field.
  - Rotating tetrimino blocks 90 degrees at a time.
  - Starting a new game when an old one is finished.

Functionality of the game:
  - Creating tetrimino blocks in random sequence.
  - Score keeping.
  - Removal of full rows.
  - Showing the next tetrimo block that is going to appear in the playing field.
  - Lifting the level of difficulty (by increasing the speed that the tetriminoes fall down the playing field) after every 10 rows removed.
